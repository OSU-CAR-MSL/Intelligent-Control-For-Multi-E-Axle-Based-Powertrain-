#Overview
The intelligent control of heavy-duty electric vehicles consists of three steps. In the first step, the strategy leverages information about upcoming driving conditions (e.g., speed limits, road grade, and lead vehicle behavior) to adjust vehicle speed optimally, which leads to reduced energy consumption while balancing travel time. The second step operates at the powertrain level, optimally distributing torque among multiple e-axles to minimize powertrain losses. Finally, the third step focuses on component-level control, ensuring each electric machine operates in a synchronized manner, even under uneven torque allocation, to guarantee safe and reliable vehicle operation.

# Step 1: Vehicle Level Optimization 
This step formulates a cost function that combines the vehicle’s energy consumption with the speed tracking error, where the speed limit serves as the reference. A penalty factor is introduced to adjust the trade-off, allowing emphasis to be placed either on minimizing energy use or on maintaining speed tracking. The strategy leverages look-ahead information, including upcoming road grade, speed limits, and the behavior of a lead vehicle, over a defined time horizon, which is further divided into smaller segments to capture variations in the input data. Within each segment, the cost function is evaluated, and optimization techniques are applied to determine the optimal acceleration that minimizes the overall cost across the horizon. In order to solve this problem, gradient-based optimization methods are employed, and the performance of sequential quadratic programming (SQP), interior-point (IP) methods, and dynamic programming (DP) are compared. The resulting optimal acceleration is then used to compute the required driving torque. The choice of penalty factor is particularly critical for heavy-duty electric vehicles. A higher penalty on speed tracking error reduces travel delays but can increase energy usage, while prioritizing energy minimization may extend delivery time and raise operational costs. This research therefore also addresses the optimal selection of the penalty factor, ensuring a balanced trade-off between energy efficiency and travel time.
